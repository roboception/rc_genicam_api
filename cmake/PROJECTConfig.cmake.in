# (e.g. Eigen) then you need to include them here as well (the same way you
# included them in your main CMakeLists.txt) and add them to this library's
# include dirs:
#
# find_package(Eigen3 REQUIRED)
# list(APPEND @PROJECT_NAME_UPPER@_INCLUDE_DIRS	${EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR})
#
# find_package(rcXXX REQUIRED)
# list(APPEND @PROJECT_NAME_UPPER@_INCLUDE_DIRS	${RCXXX_INCLUDE_DIRS})
